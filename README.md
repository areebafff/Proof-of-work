# Proof-of-work
The idea for Proof of Work(PoW) was first published in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and was later applied by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin paper in 2008. Miners(special computers on the network) perform computation work in solving a complex mathematical problem to add the block to the network, hence named, Proof-of-Work. With time, the mathematical problem becomes more complex.
